Data Structures, Algorithms, Machine Learning, and Artificial Intelligence learner. Generally positively charged! Curious about LYGOMETRY (Things we do not know)

I would characterize myself as both a Computer Scientist and a Machine Learning Engineer and in the past, I‚Äôve tried many things before finding my way, before finding my passions. I‚Äôm an Autodidact. So, I learned a lot by myself. I self-teach a lot. I am always curious about - what I don't know? and always push myself to the limit. I love Mathematics and Theoretical Physics. Always enjoy solving any kind of puzzles. Last but not the least, Programming is very near and dear to my heart!
I was born in Chattogram, which is the port city of our country. My school and college were Chattogram Collegiate School and Haji Mohammad Moshin College. I finished my graduation in Computer Science and Engineering from Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology. I also participated in the Master's program in Data and Knowledge Engineering at Otto-von-Guericke University.
