Hello, Universe! This is Kaiser Hamid Rabbi, a Lead AI Engineer @AsthaIT, architecting reliable, multimodal AI agents and enterprise-grade LLM systems. My work bridges LLMOps, multi-GPU fine-tuning, and Applied Vision Intelligence—with a strong focus on safety, scalability, and real-world impact.

I specialize in LLMs, Agentic Frameworks, and Computer Vision, bringing hands-on experience in RAG architectures, fine-tuning with QLoRA and Unsloth, and deploying production AI pipelines on AWS. Previously, I’ve led national-scale projects spanning Automatic Number Plate Recognition, Facial Recognition, and Bengali Voice Assistant systems, driving AI innovation at scale.

Passionate about building dependable AI ecosystems, I thrive at the intersection of research and production—turning frontier models into reliable enterprise solutions.
